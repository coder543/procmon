SUMMARY

This is a really simple (but powerful) tool, so I won't waste your time.

You write a rules script, there is no standardized extension at this point.

To run the script, run procmon SCRIPTNAME

The scripts are written in a type of broken English befitting a very simple interpreter -- like this one.

CONDITION
STATEMENT
STATEMENT
STATEMENT
STATEMENT
...
endif

and repeat.

STATEMENT takes the form of any normal bash script file, until the interpreter finds 'endif'.


CONDITION takes the form of the following.

if (starts|dies|running) (the|any|all) "procname";

Were you to type any or all in the condition, you would then be allowed to have multiple process names, each individually inside quotation marks and separated by spaces.

I'm sure the interpretation engine's logic is not 100% reliable, but it works in the general cases I've tested with.

The interpreter loops over the system list of processes once per second.
